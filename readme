This is a software to tranlate vrml97 file to xml file. The translation is
based on the specification of "x3d-compact.dtd".

After extracting the v2x3d_0.1.tar, you will have a v2x3d_0.1.jar and  
directories of "javasrc", "test". In "test" directory, there is a C shell 
"v2x3dtest" and a pc batch file "v2x3dtest.bat", and some examples. 
In "javasrc" directory, there are source java programs. 

To run the translator, simply go to the directory "test", and type:

v2x3dtest vrml97file xmlfile

At present it is only work for local file.

The changes of this version (0.1) :
(1) Generate x3d-compact.dtd X3d file.
(2) Fixed the bug of DEF/USE.
(3) Moved all PROTO and EXTERNPROTO declarations to the begining.
